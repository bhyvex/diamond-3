# Metadata

> *meta·da·ta* – data that provides information about other data [^1]

There are several kind of metadata but in the context of [[Diamond wiki]],
we'll mostly discuss *descriptive metadata*, that is metadata that describes
the pages so as to provide more context.

## Adding metadata

To add metadata to a page, simply start its content with a block of the
following for:

    ---
    category: Gemstones
    tag: Shiny
    tag: Precious
    ---

The content of the block is made of key-value pairs. You can freely enter
anything that helps qualify the contents of the page. The only constraint is
that *keys* should be lowercase.

[[Diamond wiki]] will then provide you with ways of exploring, searching and
accessing your pages thanks to the metadata.
